title: "MSD panels 1, 2 and 3 Explant Supernatant"
output: github_document

## Experiment overview

These data are from running MSD analysis of supernatents from selected vaginal explant samples from seven donors. The explants were infected with HSV2 strains 186, SD90 or Mock infected by Lamar Fleming and Gabriella Fenkart and supernatents were collected at 3 timepoints post infection: 3hrs, 8hrs and 24hrs.

We used 3 different MSD panels containing a total of 20 analytes analyzed for 46 samples (see caveat). Based on results from running test samples, we decided to dilute all the supernants 1:5 with MSD's diluent 43 before running the plates. All samples (except 1, see caveats) were run in duplicate.

## Caveats

Due to limited sample volume, we had to make the following omissions:

Panel 2: Only 1 rep for sample 324-T2-V1

Panel 3: Did not run samples 324-T2-V1 or 324-T2-V2.

Due to a possible pipetting error, we were not able to use the data from the standards that we ran for panel 1. Instead, we used the standards from a different run of the same panel to calculate concentrations for the experimental samples (see explant_sup_README for details).

#reading in data from the panel 1


#remember that this data table contains data from the 17Aug16_HVE_sup_panel_1_plate_1. I am only going to use the Standards data from that plate (not the data) and not the standards from either of the plates for panel 1 run 10Aug16 since we had what appears to be a pipetting error (2nd replicate is more concentrated for all wells).

## Checking Standard Recovery and Curves


Here are plots of the % recovery (extrapolated concentration/ known concentration x 100) for the standards that were either within or above the detection range, with lines at the "good recovery" limits of 80 and 120% recovery.

The R^2^ values for goodness-of-fit for the standard curves were all >0.99

```

## Caveats about Standards

* Standards with values *below the detection range* (<2.5x the standard deviation of the lowest standard) give unreliable concentrations, so I did not include those in the plots.

* When standards are *below the curve fit* (outside the range of the standard curve), the software does not calculate concentrations so you can't get a percent recovery.

* Most of the Standards that fell into either of these categories were from STD-07 or STD-08 except for two that were STD-06:

* I multiplied by the dilution factor so this is an estimated concentration of the stock samples.

* Note that this is on a log(10) scale; most concentrations are a lot lower than the high ones.

We did a 1:5 dilution of the samples so I multiplied the concentrations by 5 to get an estimate of the stock supernatent concentration. 

If a sample had one rep that was below detection and another that was in range, I used the remaining "in range" rep as the "average" for that sample.

Here is the same heat map with some changes to to Assay names and order:

```{r rename analytes logFC heatmap, echo=FALSE}

#make a new column to hold the new names
merge24And3<-merge24And3 %>%
  mutate(altAssayNames = ifelse(Assay == "MIG",
                                "CXCL9",
                                ifelse(Assay == "IP-10",
                                       "CXCL10",
                                       ifelse(Assay == "IL1-RA","IL-1RA",as.character(Assay)))))

#factor the new assay names in the order FH wanted:
#Note that the FIRST level will be at the bottom of the heat map axis!!!


merge24And3$altAssayNames<-factor(merge24And3$altAssayNames)

```

This is a heat map showing the same data as above, but fewer analytes
```{r analyte subset heatmap, echo=FALSE}

#want a heat map that just shows CXCL9, IL-1a, IL-10 and MIP-1b, in that order.

#I'm making a vector of the ones I want so I can avoid typing the stupid greek letters.

assaysIwant<- levels(merge24And3$altAssayNames)
assaysIwant<- assaysIwant[c(6,9,17,20)]



analyteSubset<- merge24And3 %>%
  filter(altAssayNames %in% assaysIwant)



#Recall that the order of the factors well get plotted bottom to top, to the one you want at the BOTTOM of hte axis needs to be in factor positiojn [1]
analyteSubset$altAssayNames <- factor(analyteSubset$altAssayNames, levels (analyteSubset$altAssayNames) [c(6,9,17,20)])
