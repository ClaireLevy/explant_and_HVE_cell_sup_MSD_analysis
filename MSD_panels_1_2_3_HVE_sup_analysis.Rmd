## Experiment overview

These data are from running MSD analysis of supernatents from selected ex vivo vaginal epithelial cells from three donors. The explants were infected with HSV2 strains 186, SD90 or Mock infected by Lamar Fleming and Gabriella Fenkart and supernatents were collected at 3 timepoints post-infection: 3hrs, 8hrs and 24hrs.

We used 3 different MSD panels containing a total of 20 analytes analyzed for 24 samples. Based on results from running test samples and from running the explant supernatent samples, we decided to dilute all the supernants 1:2 (plate 1) and 1:5 (plate 2) with MSD's diluent 43 before running the plates. All samples were run in duplicate.

## Checking Standard Recovery and Curves


Here are plots of the % recovery (extrapolated concentration/ known concentration x 100) for the standards that were either within or above the detection range, with lines at the "good recovery" limits of 80 and 120% recovery.

The R^2^ values for goodness-of-fit for the standard curves were all >0.99

```{r standards,fig.height = 7, fig.width = 12, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}


HVE_stds_all_panels<-filter(HVE_all_panels, Sample.Group == "Standards")



#which standards are out of det. range?

```


## Caveats about Standards

* Standards with values *below the detection range* (<2.5x the standard deviation of the lowest standard) give unreliable concentrations, so I did not include those in the plots.

* When standards are *below the curve fit* (outside the range of the standard curve), the software does not calculate concentrations so you can't get a percent recovery.

* Most of the Standards that fell into either of these categories were from STD-07 or STD-08 except for five that were STD-06:

`r pander(HVE_stds_all_panels_below)`


```{r break up sample name, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Making a df that contains just the non-standards 

HVE_all_panels_noStds <- HVE_all_panels %>%
  filter(Sample.Group!="Standards")
  
  
# I want to be able to group the data by timepoint and donor and virus so I need to break up components of the the sample name and make new columns with just the Donor, Timepoint, Virus and Sample_Dilution.

#Split samples names on the "-"
donorTimeVirusDil<-colsplit(HVE_all_panels_noStds$Sample,"-", c("Donor","Timepoint","Virus", "Sample_Dilution") )

#bind the split col back to allPanels

HVE_all_panels_noStds<-cbind(donorTimeVirusDil, HVE_all_panels_noStds)

#Make things factors so they plot nicely
HVE_all_panels_noStds$Donor <- as.factor(HVE_all_panels_noStds$Donor)

## HVE Supernatents: Detection Range

The following plots show that the 1:2 dilution of the samples resulted in more samples being in "In Detection Range." 

```{r checking detection range, fig.height=8, fig.width =12, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#What number of samples are in each category of detection? Also adding a column to differentiate which analyte is in which panel, mostly for facetting reasons.

```{r multiplying by dilution factor, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

#I'm going to make a column for estimated stock concentration by multiplying the avgConc by 2 or 5 (since I did a 1:2 and 1:5 dilution on the samples) so I can better compare with the explant sup concentrations.

  mutate(Estimated_Stock_Conc = ifelse(
    Sample_Dilution == "1:2", Calc..Concentration * 2,
    ifelse(Sample_Dilution == "1:5", Calc..Concentration *5, NA)
  ))

```




```{r adjust belows, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Samples that are "Below Detection Range" means that the signal was "statistically indistinguishable from the background or top of the curve"" and ..."The concentrations calculated are inherently unreliable."

#HOWEVER, we still want to show the fact that those samples had really low concentrations. So, I am going to set all those samples to 0.001 so they show up on plots.


HVE_all_panels_noStds_AdjBelow <- HVE_all_panels_noStds %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Stock_Conc = ifelse(str_detect(Detection.Range,"Below"),0.01, Estimated_Stock_Conc))
```

## Estimated Sample Concentration Distribution

* I multiplied by the dilution factors so this is an estimated concentration of the stock samples.

* Note that this is on a log(10) scale; most concentrations are a lot lower than the high ones.

```{r filter for 1:2, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
### NOTE ### I'm going to filter for just the 1:2 dilution samples here since they gave more in-detection.

#There were a few samples where the 1:2 dilution was above the fit curve range but it was in range for 1:5. I am going to extract those samples and add them to the df I made above, along with their corresponding Mock samples (which are also in range

Recall that I assigned all below range/curve reps a value of 0.01. If both reps were below, ok to use calculate the average of them.

#Also, in cases where the Mock values are > Virus values, we would get a negative number for the result and not be able to plot it on a log scale. So I will take the log of each, then subtract, then plot on a linear scale, so I can have the negatives there. 

#Recall that log(a/b) = log(a)-log(b)

## Plots of Analyte Concentrations by Donor, Timepoint and Condition

## Caveats

If a sample had one rep that was below detection and another that was in range, I used the remaining "in range" rep as the "average" for that sample.


```{r  individual analyte plots, echo=FALSE,fig.width=8, fig.height = 10, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

   facet_grid(Assay~Virus, scales = "free_x")+
